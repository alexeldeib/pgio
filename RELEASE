					pgio v1.0


The acronym pgio stands for PostgreSQL I/O. This software, pgio, is the only authorized implementation of 
the "SLOB Method" for PostgreSQL. In other words, this is a port of the essential SLOB functionality to
PostgreSQL so users familiar with the "SLOB Method" can test PostgreSQL in a similiar manner. 

For more information on SLOB, please see www.kevinclosson.net.
